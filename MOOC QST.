1. Create a database named CompanyDB




2.Create two tables:
    Employees (EmpID, Name, Department, Salary )
    Departments (DeptID, DeptName, Location)


3. Insert at least  5 records into the  table employees and  3 records into the department table.


4. Write SQL queries to:

a) Select employees whose names start with ‘A’ using LIKE.

mysql> select * FROM Employees where Name like 'a%';
+-------+--------+------------+--------+
| EmpID | Name   | Department | salary |
+-------+--------+------------+--------+
|     1 | amina  | manager    |  50000 |
|     4 | ayisha | HR manager |  55000 |
+-------+--------+------------+--------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

b) Display the total number of employees in each department using GROUP BY.

mysql> SELECT Department, count(*) as total_Employees from Employees GROUP BY Department;
+-------------+-----------------+
| Department  | total_Employees |
+-------------+-----------------+
| manager     |               1 |
| Ast.manager |               1 |
| CEO         |               1 |
| HR manager  |               1 |
| finance     |               1 |
+-------------+-----------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)


c) Retrieve all employee details sorted by salary in descending order using ORDER BY.
mysql>  select * from Employees order by salary desc;
+-------+----------+-------------+--------+
| EmpID | Name     | Department  | salary |
+-------+----------+-------------+--------+
|     3 | kadheeja | CEO         | 100000 |
|     5 | richu    | finance     |  60000 |
|     4 | ayisha   | HR manager  |  55000 |
|     1 | amina    | manager     |  50000 |
|     2 | fathima  | Ast.manager |  40000 |
+-------+----------+-------------+--------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)


d) Fetch employee names, their departments, and department locations using JOIN.

mysql> select Employees.Name,Employees.Department,Departments.Location FROM Employees join Departments on Employees.EmpID= Departments.DeptID;
+----------+-------------+----------+
| Name     | Department  | Location |
+----------+-------------+----------+
| amina    | manager     | canada   |
| fathima  | Ast.manager | kalkatta |
| kadheeja | CEO         | new york |
+----------+-------------+----------+
3 rows in set (0.00 sec)

e) Find employees earning more than the average salary using a SUBQUERY.

mysql>  select * from Employees where salary > (select avg(salary)from Employees);
+-------+----------+------------+--------+
| EmpID | Name     | Department | salary |
+-------+----------+------------+--------+
|     3 | kadheeja | CEO        | 100000 |
+-------+----------+------------+--------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)

f) Create a VIEW to display employees earning more than 55,000.

mysql> create view high_salry_Employees as select * from Employees where salary>55000;
 Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.21 sec)

mysql> select*from high_salry_Employees;
+-------+----------+------------+--------+
| EmpID | Name     | Department | salary |
+-------+----------+------------+--------+
|     3 | kadheeja | CEO        | 100000 |
|     5 | richu    | finance    |  60000 |
+-------+----------+------------+--------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)
